00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,274
Previously on
"The Vampire Diaries"...

2
00:00:02,275 --> 00:00:04,599
Wes had this scheme
to destroy vampires

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,058
by making them feed on each other.

4
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:08,508
- What's happening to you?
- Karma is happening to me.

5
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:12,930
My name is Nadia Petrova.
You are my mother.

6
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:19,222
This knife's the only thing
that will kill a passenger.

7
00:00:19,223 --> 00:00:22,121
I passengered myself
into Elena's cute, little head.

8
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,023
She's acting strange.
She kissed me.

9
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,559
Matt texted "help K,"
as in "Katherine."

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,127
Oh, my God.

11
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,529
You won't have to worry
about me for much longer.

12
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:33,265
Tyler Lockwood bit me.

13
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:54,554
Good evening, sir.

14
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,556
If I could trouble
you for a moment.

15
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,224
I'm looking for someone.

16
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,860
Her name is Katerina Petrova.

17
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:04,764
She was last seen outside
of London in 1492.

18
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:08,767
She's on the run.
I need to find her.

19
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,572
I need to ask her
why she abandoned me.

20
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,073
Nadia?

21
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:18,711
Please.
I need to know.

22
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:21,981
Nadia, I'm right here.

23
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:23,181
I'm right here.

24
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:36,729
Uhh. I was dreaming how I searched
for you from village to village.

25
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,397
I know.
I heard you.

26
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:39,932
You said that I abandoned you.

27
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,335
You were ripped
from my arms as a baby.

28
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:43,736
It's completely different.

29
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:45,605
Not for a child without a mother.

30
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:50,076
You know, all this guilt is
really taking all the fun out of

31
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:52,178
this mother-daughter outing.

32
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:56,082
I'm sorry Tyler bit you, but
you're not going to die.

33
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,850
Did you ask Klaus for his blood?

34
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:01,521
Oh, my, you really are delirious.

35
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:05,024
Nadia, he would love nothing more
than to watch my daughter die.

36
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,792
And you don't want
to risk being outed.

37
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,546
No, I don't.

38
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,667
So, that's why I called him.

39
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,769
Nice to meet you.
I'm Dr. Maxfield.

40
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,173
And luckily for us, he'll love nothing
more than to study your blood.

41
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:22,441
Werewolf venom isn't
easy to come by.

42
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:25,277
Get away from me.

43
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:28,005
It's ok.
Nadia, it's ok.

44
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:29,273
Listen to your mother.

45
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:32,611
The venom in your blood is a toxin
with basic chemical properties.

46
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:36,480
Once I study its make-up, I can...
Create the antidote.

47
00:02:37,649 --> 00:02:39,451
It's ok.
Come on, come on, honey.

48
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:40,684
There you go.

49
00:02:43,355 --> 00:02:47,492
If I'd known I just had to die to
drag your attention from Stefan,

50
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:49,878
I would have tried it
a long time ago.

51
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,199
If you're trying to
make me feel guilty...

52
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,285
It's almost working.

53
00:02:58,286 --> 00:03:00,787
I'm just glad you're here now.

54
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:02,155
Me, too.

55
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:09,396
I'm going to be a better
mother, starting right now.

56
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:15,068
I promise you... I'm
going to save your life.

58
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:25,388
she's brilliant.

59
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:28,858
We haven't noticed that
Katherine's been inhabiting.

60
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:31,928
Elena's body for weeks, and
that's all you have to say?

61
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:33,129
Yep.

62
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,099
And you realize that
it was Katherine who

63
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,967
broke up with you, it wasn't Elena.

64
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,236
Mm-hmm.

65
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:47,911
Right. So, your little murder spree
with Enzo where you killed Aaron,

66
00:03:47,912 --> 00:03:50,813
you nearly killed Jeremy, tried
to kill Wes but you got infected

67
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,115
with that ripper virus...

68
00:03:52,116 --> 00:03:56,152
That was all you
reacting to Katherine.

69
00:03:56,153 --> 00:04:01,024
I'm trying to figure out why you
decided to tell a starving,

70
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:04,961
bloodthirsty, vampire-feeding
ripper that his Nemesis is still

71
00:04:04,962 --> 00:04:08,631
walking around alive and well
while I am stuck in this cell

72
00:04:08,632 --> 00:04:10,532
and can't do anything about it.

73
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:12,035
I have it under control.

74
00:04:12,036 --> 00:04:14,169
I'd love to hear this.

75
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,673
Hang on here.
Katherine's still alive?

76
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:17,974
How is that even possible?

77
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:21,411
Remember that time Nadia's ex
Gregor hitched a ride in your head?

78
00:04:21,412 --> 00:04:22,879
Ok, well, it's kind
of the same thing.

79
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,047
Katherine is a passenger in Elena,

80
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:27,584
except it's worse because
none of us seemed to notice.

81
00:04:27,585 --> 00:04:28,651
She was at my house.

82
00:04:28,652 --> 00:04:30,118
How did none of us figure it out?

83
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,155
Because it's Katherine,
and she's smart,

84
00:04:32,156 --> 00:04:35,658
and conniving and sneaky
and...

85
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:37,760
We're the worst friends ever.

86
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:39,529
This makes no sense.

87
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,897
She saved my life.

88
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:43,031
She gave me CPR when
Enzo tried to kill me.

89
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,399
Katherine would never do that.

90
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:46,035
That's what made her so believable.

91
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,303
She played Elena to a t.

92
00:04:47,304 --> 00:04:49,405
If she let you die,
her cover was blown.

93
00:04:49,406 --> 00:04:51,307
I was sleeping
3 feet away from her.

94
00:04:51,308 --> 00:04:53,109
She picked out
my bitter ball dress.

95
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,111
And I let her use my toothpaste.

96
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:58,480
Yeah, well, did she lure you into a
hotel room to make out with you?

97
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,684
She's the reason I found out
about you and Klaus.

98
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:06,154
Of course.
Oh, my God.

99
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:09,025
So, how do we kill the bitch?

100
00:05:09,026 --> 00:05:12,161
Well, passengers can be
expelled from the host.

101
00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:13,696
Saw it happen with Matt.

102
00:05:13,697 --> 00:05:15,664
Gregor died and Matt lived.

103
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,833
All we have to do is
stab her with a traveler knife.

104
00:05:17,835 --> 00:05:20,336
I still have the knife
that Nadia gave me.

105
00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:21,371
Perfect. Go get it.

106
00:05:21,372 --> 00:05:24,240
Hold on, guys, this is Katherine
that we're talking about.

107
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,477
She's gonna see a sneak attack
coming from a mile away.

108
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:29,212
We gotta get her to come to us.

109
00:05:29,213 --> 00:05:30,880
Get her guard down.
Corner her.

110
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:32,915
Fat chance you'll be
seeing her today.

111
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,716
I'm pretty sure I bit Nadia.

112
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:37,320
What do you mean you bit her?

113
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:40,023
I mean she was attacking Caroline
and I might've nipped her a little.

114
00:05:40,024 --> 00:05:41,724
And you're just
mentioning this now?

115
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:43,993
Hey, guys, focus.
Tyler's right.

116
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:45,895
Katherine is not
going to leave Nadia's side

117
00:05:45,896 --> 00:05:49,032
unless not leaving
compromises her identity.

118
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:50,198
Which means?

119
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:55,004
We gotta invite her to something
that Elena can't say no to.

120
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:57,939
A surprise party?
Seriously?

121
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,043
I wanted a spa day.

122
00:06:00,044 --> 00:06:01,411
You try feeling the death of every

123
00:06:01,412 --> 00:06:02,712
supernatural creature
who passes through you

124
00:06:02,713 --> 00:06:04,113
on their way to the other side.

125
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,748
I'm not saying
you don't deserve it.

126
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:07,917
Besides, your birthday
isn't until next week.

127
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:09,719
That's what makes it a surprise.

128
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,023
Yeah, I don't think Bonnie would
want a big party for her birthday.

129
00:06:14,024 --> 00:06:15,558
Of course she does.

130
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:18,294
So, when can you get over to
Stefan's to help us set up?

131
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:21,497
I can't.

132
00:06:21,498 --> 00:06:22,732
You can't.

133
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:25,802
I would love to,
but I just... I can't.

134
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:31,039
Um... I'm making arrangements
for Aaron Whitmore's funeral.

135
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,711
The only reason Damon killed him
was because we broke up, so,

136
00:06:34,712 --> 00:06:36,712
I kind of feel like
I owe it to Aaron.

137
00:06:37,547 --> 00:06:38,814
You understand, right?

138
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,750
Of course.

139
00:06:40,751 --> 00:06:42,551
No, that's really nice of you.

140
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:50,325
Elena, you're so popular today.

141
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,029
Hey, Bonnie.

142
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,997
Hey. How's it going?

143
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,466
You sound tired.

144
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:59,535
Yeah. I had to pull an all-nighter
for my sociology exam

145
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:00,737
and then woke up to a coven of

146
00:07:00,738 --> 00:07:03,940
dead Russian witches passing through
me on the way to the other side.

147
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:06,943
Sorry. Self-pity.
So not cute.

148
00:07:06,944 --> 00:07:11,614
No, I totally get it.
You're the anchor now.

149
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:15,284
That must be...
exhausting.

150
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:18,087
Do you want to maybe meet up
for a coffee or something?

151
00:07:18,088 --> 00:07:20,923
It's just been one of
those days, you know?

152
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:22,891
Yeah. Well, ha!

153
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:27,130
This is gonna sound crazy, but I'm
actually at the day spa right now

154
00:07:27,131 --> 00:07:29,799
buying you a gift certificate
for your birthday.

155
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,237
It was supposed to be a surprise
but, well, surprise!

156
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:38,174
You read my mind.
That's so you.

157
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:40,309
Hey, look, I'll check
in with you later.

158
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,645
Ok.

159
00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:45,981
Why are
they being so clingy today?

160
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,521
What are you doing?

161
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,528
There you go. Drink.

162
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,035
I need more.

163
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:07,036
Too bad.

164
00:08:07,037 --> 00:08:08,236
That was nothing.

165
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,372
That's exactly 4 ounces.

166
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:10,773
When you were out killing vampires,

167
00:08:10,774 --> 00:08:13,109
you said one vampire
kept you good for 8 hours.

168
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,113
So, our friend Caroline did a
little bit of math... Caroline?

169
00:08:17,114 --> 00:08:18,447
Relax. She had a calculator.

170
00:08:18,448 --> 00:08:21,617
So, 4 ounces 3 times a day

171
00:08:21,618 --> 00:08:24,353
should be just enough
to help manage the hunger.

172
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:30,293
You mean manage me.

173
00:08:30,294 --> 00:08:32,395
So you don't rip anyone's head off.

174
00:08:32,396 --> 00:08:35,364
We'll deal with your crisis
once we get Elena back.

175
00:08:35,365 --> 00:08:37,033
I'll deal with my own crisis.

176
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:38,768
Listen, you just
let me out of here.

177
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,503
I'll find Wes, I'll
get the antidote.

178
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:42,905
And then what, huh?
You skip town?

179
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:46,108
Leave it to me to tell Elena
everything you did after you thought

180
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,944
she broke up with you?

181
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:53,549
Who are you calling there, buddy?

182
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,251
Katherine's been making
a lot of excuses

183
00:08:55,252 --> 00:08:58,054
and I have a feeling she won't
be able to say no to me.

184
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:10,866
It's your phone.
Elena is calling.

185
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:14,003
Answer it.

186
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:17,907
Elena. Hey.

187
00:09:17,908 --> 00:09:20,877
Hey. Um... how are you?

188
00:09:20,878 --> 00:09:24,247
Well, you know.
Strung up, hungry.

189
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:25,982
Same old, same old.

190
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:31,487
Now that the dust has settled, I was
hoping that, I don't know, maybe

191
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,989
we can talk about what
happened at the farmhouse.

192
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:36,358
Can I see you?

193
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:39,929
Ok. Sure.

194
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,266
Why don't you just come to the house
and we'll talk about it here?

195
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:45,935
Perfect.
I'll see you soon.

196
00:09:45,936 --> 00:09:48,069
Ok. Bye.

197
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:58,748
Damon knows that he tried to
kill me less than 24 hours ago.

198
00:09:58,749 --> 00:10:03,251
There isn't a single
vampire-craving bone in his body

199
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:06,122
that would risk putting
his precious Elena

200
00:10:06,123 --> 00:10:08,324
back in that kind of danger again.

201
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:11,360
And yet he's desperate to see her.

202
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,395
Just like her other friends.

203
00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:21,337
They know.

204
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:22,905
Doesn't make any sense.

205
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:25,441
She's dodged everyone's attempt
to try to get her over here.

206
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:27,343
Now she voluntarily
wants to come over?

207
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:28,945
Unless...

208
00:10:28,946 --> 00:10:30,512
Unless?

209
00:10:31,747 --> 00:10:33,381
She was testing me.

210
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:37,686
She knows.

211
00:11:01,277 --> 00:11:03,246
Money for information.

212
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:06,249
I was told you saw Katerina
Petrova kill a man in cold blood

213
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,250
outside the court of versailles.

214
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:11,153
I want to know if that's true.

215
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:15,390
I want to know what kind
of person my mother is.

216
00:11:16,526 --> 00:11:22,525
She's been on the run
for... 228 years.

217
00:11:24,401 --> 00:11:27,136
You passed out in the car.

218
00:11:27,137 --> 00:11:28,470
I didn't want to wake you.

219
00:11:33,798 --> 00:11:37,569
Huh. Perfect.

220
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,837
I can make my peace
with the universe.

221
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,107
Don't talk like that. I brought
you here so that I could hide you

222
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:45,910
till Wes finds a way to heal you.

223
00:11:45,911 --> 00:11:49,847
You should leave now.
While you can.

224
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:51,849
There's no point
in trying to save me.

225
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:53,630
I didn't raise you to be a quitter.

226
00:11:54,953 --> 00:11:58,718
And I promise... As soon as you
get better, we're leaving.

227
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:02,639
Together.

228
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:06,331
Of course.

229
00:12:06,332 --> 00:12:07,732
The farther she gets,
the worse our chances

230
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:09,667
are of ever seeing Elena again.

231
00:12:09,668 --> 00:12:12,403
It's bad enough that we didn't
recognize Katherine.

232
00:12:12,404 --> 00:12:14,706
We also just blew
our only advantage.

233
00:12:14,707 --> 00:12:17,642
Nothing a little
locator spell can't fix.

234
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:34,557
Let me guess.
Matter of life and death?

235
00:12:34,558 --> 00:12:38,127
Kind of. Yeah, um, do
you remember that locator spell

236
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:39,162
we did the other night?

237
00:12:39,163 --> 00:12:44,133
Sure. We ended up saving him.

238
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:46,015
You're welcome, by the way.

239
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:50,340
Now we need you to find his sister.

240
00:12:50,341 --> 00:12:52,308
Why? She run away from home?

241
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:56,179
No. She's been possessed
by her evil doppelganger.

242
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,047
Ok...

243
00:12:58,048 --> 00:12:59,181
Liv.

244
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:00,949
Will you help us?

245
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:04,553
I can be convinced.

246
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:10,193
Need blood.

247
00:13:10,194 --> 00:13:12,462
You just had your lunch
30 minutes ago.

248
00:13:12,463 --> 00:13:17,333
Or you could give me a couple
sips of that hybrid juice.

249
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:21,738
I can be on my way and I'll take
up my ripper situation with Wes.

250
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:23,094
Not gonna happen.

251
00:13:27,645 --> 00:13:31,246
Can I ask you a question without
you getting all wolf man on me?

252
00:13:31,248 --> 00:13:33,349
Do I have a choice?

253
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,151
Why are you still here?

254
00:13:35,152 --> 00:13:37,020
I'm a hybrid and you
need a baby-sitter.

255
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:40,723
Oh, no, I mean here here,
in Mystic Falls here.

256
00:13:40,724 --> 00:13:42,458
Your famila's all dead
and I don't see you

257
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:44,294
getting a job at the Grill.

258
00:13:44,295 --> 00:13:47,263
Yet I don't see you
in a Whitmore hoodie, either.

259
00:13:47,264 --> 00:13:49,399
Something tells me
that there's a little

260
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,869
masochistic voice inside your head
that's trying to convince you

261
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,205
that you and Caroline still
have a fighting chance in hell.

262
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:02,045
I think you have enough problems
without having to worry about me.

263
00:14:02,046 --> 00:14:04,247
You're probably right.

264
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,751
One small difference
between you and me...

265
00:14:08,752 --> 00:14:10,920
- You want to hear it?
- Not especially.

266
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:15,023
You see, even after
all the terrible things I do,

267
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:17,427
Elena still chose me.

268
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:19,595
Because she's fighting for me.

269
00:14:19,596 --> 00:14:23,166
Caroline, on the other hand,
chose the nuclear option.

270
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:24,834
You know that big,
red button that just

271
00:14:24,835 --> 00:14:27,337
nukes your entire relationship
once and for all?

272
00:14:27,338 --> 00:14:30,206
Well, sleeping with the
guy that killed your mom

273
00:14:30,207 --> 00:14:33,041
was kind of her way of
slamming her hand down.

274
00:14:34,844 --> 00:14:37,013
You think Elena will still
want you back after this?

275
00:14:37,014 --> 00:14:40,450
It's over, Damon.
Fix yourself and run.

276
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:41,451
Far away.

277
00:14:41,452 --> 00:14:42,885
I plan on it.

278
00:14:42,886 --> 00:14:44,675
How's New Orleans
this time of year?

279
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,023
You really think
Elena's gonna forgive you?

280
00:14:48,992 --> 00:14:51,728
Look at you.
You killed her friend.

281
00:14:51,729 --> 00:14:54,063
You almost killed her brother.
You nearly killed her.

282
00:14:54,064 --> 00:14:55,765
You're a joke, Damon.

283
00:14:55,766 --> 00:14:58,367
Says the guy pining after
the girl who slept with Klaus.

284
00:14:59,402 --> 00:15:00,869
You don't know anything about me.

285
00:15:00,871 --> 00:15:02,771
I know how to get you in this cell.

286
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,640
Ooh! Aah!

287
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,383
Hey, ready for a changing of the guard...
Oh, my God.

288
00:15:28,384 --> 00:15:31,386
- Oh, my God. Tyler?
- I'm ok.

289
00:15:31,387 --> 00:15:33,388
- He fed on you?
- I said I'm fine.

290
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:36,224
- Why would you come in here?
- Why do you think?

291
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:38,559
Damon knew exactly
how to piss me off.

292
00:15:40,028 --> 00:15:41,229
What the hell happened?

293
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,363
I think Damon went to go find Wes.

294
00:15:48,002 --> 00:15:52,674
Elena's necklace.
Candle. Map.

295
00:15:52,675 --> 00:15:54,909
Give me your hand.

296
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,444
You're Elena's brother.
That makes you blood.

297
00:15:56,445 --> 00:15:58,313
So, hand it over.

298
00:15:58,314 --> 00:15:59,814
Actually, he's her cousin.

299
00:15:59,815 --> 00:16:01,082
It's a long story.

300
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,649
Whatever.
Close enough.

301
00:16:06,488 --> 00:16:08,255
That's not...
That's not how I taught you.

302
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,359
Relax, Mr. Miyagi.

303
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,928
I'm feeling my way through it, ok?

304
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:15,396
Now, what do I say, again?

305
00:16:15,397 --> 00:16:20,368
Phesmatos tribum nas ex viras,
sequitas sanguinem.

306
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:24,071
Phesmatos tribum nas ex
viras, sequitas sanguinem.

307
00:16:29,377 --> 00:16:30,912
Does Elena look anything like you?

308
00:16:30,913 --> 00:16:32,814
Uh, same color hair.

309
00:16:32,815 --> 00:16:33,915
What about her eyes?

310
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,250
Are they as pretty as yours?

311
00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:36,751
Is this really necessary?

312
00:16:36,752 --> 00:16:40,588
I'm sorry. I'm searching for his
sister/cousin's doppelganger

313
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:42,289
in my mind.

314
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,891
I'll take all the help I can get.

315
00:16:45,793 --> 00:16:51,792
Phesmatos tribum nas ex viras,
sequitas sanguinem.

316
00:16:52,134 --> 00:16:58,739
Phesmatos tribum nas ex
viras, sequitas... sanguinem.

317
00:17:04,712 --> 00:17:07,068
Does your sister spend
a lot of time in church?

318
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,150
Are you leaving?

319
00:17:11,152 --> 00:17:12,854
I'm going to check on Wes.

320
00:17:12,855 --> 00:17:14,355
He's taking too long.

321
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:15,722
Be careful.

322
00:17:16,991 --> 00:17:19,327
They're all out looking for you.

323
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:21,329
That's never stopped me before.

324
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,462
Huh.

325
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:49,156
Hello?

326
00:18:00,302 --> 00:18:01,469
What's up, doc?

327
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,770
How did you find me?

328
00:18:02,771 --> 00:18:04,172
I called my friend Enzo
and asked him about

329
00:18:04,173 --> 00:18:06,139
the little adventure
he had with you.

330
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:10,578
Gotta say, long way off
the tenure track, huh?

331
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:14,482
Huh. I take it the Augustine society
hit a bit of a rough streak.

332
00:18:14,483 --> 00:18:17,385
There is no Augustine
society, Damon.

333
00:18:17,386 --> 00:18:19,454
It's just me.

334
00:18:19,455 --> 00:18:22,123
Well, then I guess you're my guy.

335
00:18:22,124 --> 00:18:24,125
You see, I have this
long road ahead of me

336
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:25,660
to win my ex-girlfriend back.

337
00:18:25,661 --> 00:18:29,731
But I don't have a chance in hell
if I'm lusting over her blood.

338
00:18:29,732 --> 00:18:30,865
Follow?

339
00:18:30,866 --> 00:18:34,302
Even if I did cure you of this
virus, what difference does it make?

340
00:18:34,303 --> 00:18:36,037
So you stop feeding on your friends

341
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:38,271
and go back to feeding
on innocent people.

342
00:18:38,273 --> 00:18:40,974
Is that really gonna
impress Elena Gilbert?

343
00:18:42,543 --> 00:18:44,712
Look at me.

344
00:18:44,713 --> 00:18:46,514
You did this to me.

345
00:18:46,515 --> 00:18:48,683
I didn't do this to you.
You are this.

346
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:50,504
I simply held up the mirror.

347
00:18:56,024 --> 00:18:57,725
Now it's my turn to play doctor.

348
00:19:25,186 --> 00:19:26,520
That was fun.

349
00:19:27,522 --> 00:19:28,556
You think?

350
00:19:28,557 --> 00:19:31,125
You must really trust Rebekah.

351
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:32,527
Huh?

352
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:33,961
Watch this.

353
00:19:33,962 --> 00:19:35,929
I'm going to steal her earrings...

354
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:42,970
And you're not going
to say anything.

355
00:19:42,971 --> 00:19:47,608
See? You're hanging out
with an original vampire

356
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:50,778
and you're not even
on vervain. Trust.

357
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:52,580
You know she's an original?

358
00:19:52,581 --> 00:19:54,649
I recognized her
on the dance floor.

359
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,250
I was hoping she'd
know something about

360
00:19:56,251 --> 00:20:01,089
her brother Klaus'
favorite vampire:

361
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,557
Katherine Pierce.

362
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:04,792
Maybe you heard of her?

363
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:09,130
Yeah. Yeah, I've heard of her.

364
00:20:09,131 --> 00:20:12,300
I know her.
Why do you care?

365
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:17,471
Because she is my mother, and
I'd very much like to meet her.

366
00:20:19,941 --> 00:20:21,575
I'm going to take your ring.

367
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:27,114
Now I have a reason
to see you again.

368
00:20:33,721 --> 00:20:36,490
Wes? What the hell
is taking so I...

369
00:20:41,596 --> 00:20:44,431
No. No.
Please, no. No.

370
00:21:00,582 --> 00:21:02,316
Nadia, I'm coming back
to the church right now.

371
00:21:02,317 --> 00:21:05,452
She's not at the church anymore.
She's with me at home.

372
00:21:09,457 --> 00:21:11,893
Stefan, why do you have
Nadia's phone?

373
00:21:11,894 --> 00:21:14,027
She doesn't have much
time left, Katherine.

374
00:21:16,164 --> 00:21:17,898
I don't know what
you're talking about.

375
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,201
I know that it's you and I
know that you care about Nadia.

376
00:21:21,203 --> 00:21:22,736
That's why I brought her here.

377
00:21:23,905 --> 00:21:25,238
Prove it.

378
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,641
Put her on the phone.

379
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:39,853
Katherine?

380
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,057
Run.

381
00:21:47,562 --> 00:21:50,297
You can always run, Katherine.
It's what you do best.

382
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:52,066
Or you can come home
and see your daughter

383
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:54,000
one last time before she dies.

384
00:21:55,736 --> 00:21:57,003
It's your choice.

385
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:29,180
Your hands are like ice.

386
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,452
Gregor.

387
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:34,753
No, it's Matt.
I'm not...

388
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:37,054
Gregor, I'm sorry I betrayed you.

389
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,892
I did it for my mother.

390
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:43,995
I did everything for her.

391
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,398
I know you did.

392
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,569
Forgive me?

393
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,210
Yes. I forgive you.

394
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:07,419
Hey, hey. Shh.

395
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,888
It's ok.
It's ok. Shh.

396
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:17,595
I... I don't want to die.

397
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,265
I don't want to die.

398
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:38,683
What's gonna happen when I die?

399
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,186
I'll take your hand...

400
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,692
And you'll go to the other side.

401
00:23:46,693 --> 00:23:47,925
Just like that.

402
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,095
Will it hurt?

403
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,398
You won't feel any pain.

404
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,906
I'm here to see my daughter.

405
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,618
Nadia.

406
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,497
You came back for me.

407
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:27,966
I won't leave you again.

408
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,934
Did you find a way to save me?

409
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,440
Klaus' blood would've saved you...

410
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:40,644
If I'd asked for it.

411
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:44,750
You would have outed yourself.

412
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:46,584
But you would've been alive.

413
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,155
And now it's too late.

414
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,005
My mother's name is Katherine.

415
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,009
I'm looking for her.

416
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,677
You found me.
Nadia, I'm right here.

417
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:19,183
She's a liar.
And a murderer.

418
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:25,289
She manipulates.
She betrays.

419
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,693
She will do anything to survive.

420
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:36,601
Nadia. No, I'm...

421
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:38,002
I'm right here.

422
00:25:39,222 --> 00:25:41,424
Nadia, look at me.
Look at me.

423
00:25:41,425 --> 00:25:43,125
I'm here.
I'm right here.

424
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,597
I'm looking for my mother.

425
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,507
This is not what your
life should've been.

426
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:10,085
500 years searching for a mother
who ended up...  being me.

427
00:26:22,465 --> 00:26:25,935
Let me show you what
your life should've been.

428
00:26:25,936 --> 00:26:30,350
What your perfect day
would have been like.

429
00:26:35,077 --> 00:26:37,813
You and I had a little cottage.

430
00:26:37,814 --> 00:26:40,683
It was an ordinary summer day.

431
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:42,785
You'd been playing outside.

432
00:26:42,786 --> 00:26:45,655
So, you were tired
and it was time for bed.

433
00:26:45,656 --> 00:26:47,898
You told me about
the fort that you'd built.

434
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:50,526
Out in the woods by the river.

435
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:53,528
And so I asked if I could visit.

436
00:26:55,631 --> 00:27:00,435
And you said when the sun came
up in the morning, and I said...

437
00:27:01,971 --> 00:27:03,622
Good night, Nadia.

438
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:16,945
Sleep well.

439
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:34,569
Your mother loves you.

440
00:28:23,085 --> 00:28:24,386
Uhh!

441
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:09,716
So.

442
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:14,921
This is it.

443
00:29:22,596 --> 00:29:24,531
Hello, Katherine.

444
00:29:24,532 --> 00:29:26,634
You didn't think I'd
miss this, did you?

445
00:29:38,812 --> 00:29:42,483
Ok. So.

446
00:29:42,484 --> 00:29:43,983
Who's got the knife?

447
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:47,087
Which one of you is gonna get to

448
00:29:47,088 --> 00:29:50,957
kill the elusive Katherine Pierce
once and for all?

449
00:29:56,764 --> 00:30:00,166
What? Suddenly
everyone's speechless?

450
00:30:01,502 --> 00:30:04,103
When I was on my deathbed,
you all had plenty to say.

451
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:09,043
Is it you, Tyler?

452
00:30:09,044 --> 00:30:11,679
Because I triggered
the werewolf curse?

453
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,415
Gave you an identity
and made you matter?

454
00:30:14,416 --> 00:30:16,016
You've done nothing for me.

455
00:30:16,017 --> 00:30:17,318
Oh, please, Tyler.

456
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:20,788
If I hadn't walked into your life,
you'd just be a wasted nobody

457
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:24,925
with a boozy mom
and a temper problem.

458
00:30:24,926 --> 00:30:26,158
Don't. Don't.

459
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:28,395
And you.

460
00:30:28,396 --> 00:30:30,631
I'm not worried
about you offing me.

461
00:30:30,632 --> 00:30:33,800
Because we both know I made you
better by making you a vampire.

462
00:30:35,536 --> 00:30:37,404
Good-bye, Katherine.

463
00:30:37,405 --> 00:30:38,705
Bye-bye, Caroline.

464
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:43,143
Ooh. The one girl here

465
00:30:43,144 --> 00:30:46,113
who actually appreciates
how beautiful you are.

466
00:30:46,114 --> 00:30:49,249
You wouldn't stab me
in the heart, would you?

467
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:51,385
No, I don't think so.

468
00:30:51,386 --> 00:30:55,221
You will definitely go down
as the best night I never had.

469
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,891
- Oh, well.
- Oh, well.

470
00:31:01,895 --> 00:31:05,899
Well, little Gilbert, it
was nice to have a brother

471
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,935
for a second there.

472
00:31:07,936 --> 00:31:10,203
When you weren't being
so damn annoying!

473
00:31:12,006 --> 00:31:14,074
Bon Bon, no need for good-byes.

474
00:31:14,075 --> 00:31:15,608
I'll see you on the flip side.

475
00:31:20,948 --> 00:31:26,186
Damon. Oh, how you'd love nothing
more than to drive that blade

476
00:31:26,187 --> 00:31:28,088
right through me.

477
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:31,558
We've already done this, Kitty Kat.

478
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:33,260
I've said all I needed to say.

479
00:31:33,261 --> 00:31:36,662
I know, but I never got to say
what I needed to say to you.

480
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:40,533
I'm sorry.

481
00:31:43,404 --> 00:31:45,538
You blame me for who you are.

482
00:31:47,941 --> 00:31:49,342
And I'm sorry.

483
00:31:50,644 --> 00:31:53,179
I'm sorry that I turned you.

484
00:31:53,181 --> 00:31:56,417
I'm sorry that you
didn't get to die

485
00:31:56,418 --> 00:31:59,920
as a forgotten nobody
on a bloody battlefield,

486
00:31:59,921 --> 00:32:02,222
and your father didn't
get to live another day

487
00:32:02,223 --> 00:32:04,258
to be disgraced by you.

488
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:06,727
Damon, I'm sorry that I
gave your life purpose.

489
00:32:06,728 --> 00:32:10,063
Passion. Drive. Desire.

490
00:32:10,065 --> 00:32:13,734
I'm sorry that you are who you are

491
00:32:13,735 --> 00:32:15,902
because I'm the one that
taught you how to love.

492
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:20,206
I'll see you in hell, Katherine.

493
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:27,780
Stefan.

494
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:35,689
You know, I always wondered what it
would be like to be loved by you.

495
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:39,625
You've got to admit, that
one fleeting moment...

496
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:43,628
Your feelings were real.

497
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:51,137
This truly has been
the role of a lifetime.

498
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,609
Stefan, I love you.
I've always loved you.

499
00:33:10,492 --> 00:33:12,659
Mmf.

500
00:33:15,964 --> 00:33:18,906
Uhh. I guess this is how...

501
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,634
Our love story ends.

502
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:31,942
Stefan said we should
bury her in the woods.

503
00:34:35,781 --> 00:34:37,047
Screw that.

504
00:34:39,284 --> 00:34:40,584
She deserves better.

505
00:34:46,091 --> 00:34:47,792
You need some help?

506
00:34:49,795 --> 00:34:52,363
No. I got this.

507
00:35:00,305 --> 00:35:02,106
Why is she not waking up?

508
00:35:02,108 --> 00:35:05,209
When Gregor left Matt's body, it
took him a while to wake up, too.

509
00:35:07,312 --> 00:35:09,080
Which gives us a little bit of time

510
00:35:09,081 --> 00:35:11,615
to talk about what
the hell you did.

511
00:35:11,617 --> 00:35:13,985
Relax. Thanks to
Tyler's friendly donation,

512
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,655
I'll be fine for a couple hours.

513
00:35:17,455 --> 00:35:18,722
A few hours, huh?

514
00:35:20,492 --> 00:35:22,827
And then what?
What's the plan?

515
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,965
Tell her everything I did.

516
00:35:26,966 --> 00:35:29,200
Let the chips crash
and burn where they may.

517
00:35:32,771 --> 00:35:34,372
Optimistic.

518
00:35:34,373 --> 00:35:36,407
I don't want to be
another Katherine Pierce.

519
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:39,878
Katherine spent her whole life
running from her problems

520
00:35:39,879 --> 00:35:41,212
only to die here.

521
00:35:43,181 --> 00:35:45,115
All alone.

522
00:35:50,355 --> 00:35:54,325
- Is it wrong that I feel...
- Victorious?

523
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,863
Sad.

524
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:01,365
I know that Katherine is
a horrible person, but...

525
00:36:02,801 --> 00:36:04,735
But you see the good in people.

526
00:36:08,473 --> 00:36:09,709
You mean Klaus.

527
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,345
Because I saw the good in Klaus.

528
00:36:13,346 --> 00:36:15,846
Your words.
Not mine.

529
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:23,054
Your hybrid bite just killed someone
and no one even batted an eye.

530
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:26,190
I sleep with the wrong guy weeks ago
and I don't hear the end of it.

531
00:36:26,192 --> 00:36:29,113
- How is that fair?
- I don't know, Care.

532
00:36:29,114 --> 00:36:30,662
Maybe people just
expect more from you.

533
00:36:30,663 --> 00:36:34,666
Why? Because being good
comes so easy to me?

534
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:36,501
Well, guess what, Tyler?
It doesn't.

535
00:36:36,502 --> 00:36:37,702
I am a vampire.

536
00:36:37,703 --> 00:36:39,671
I have the same impulses as you.

537
00:36:39,672 --> 00:36:41,773
So, I'm allowed to make
some mistakes along the way.

538
00:36:41,774 --> 00:36:43,708
Yes, I slept with Klaus...

539
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:45,977
But after you walked away from me.

540
00:36:45,978 --> 00:36:48,113
That was my choice
and I am living with it

541
00:36:48,114 --> 00:36:51,148
and I don't need to be hearing
about it every 5 seconds.

542
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,385
So, just get over it or
get out of my life, but...

543
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:58,289
I'm done feeling guilty.

544
00:37:29,487 --> 00:37:30,921
This is for you, dad.

545
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,529
I want you to know
how much I miss you.

546
00:37:45,737 --> 00:37:47,137
You've got to be kidding me, right?

547
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:53,044
Something tells me I'm
about 5 centuries delayed

548
00:37:53,045 --> 00:37:55,747
on the whole believing
in a higher power thing.

549
00:37:55,748 --> 00:37:58,148
Well, you're here.
That means it worked.

550
00:37:59,851 --> 00:38:01,152
You're dead.

551
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,854
True.

552
00:38:02,855 --> 00:38:04,522
Then again, your friends

553
00:38:04,523 --> 00:38:07,035
didn't really give me much of
a choice in the matter.

554
00:38:08,293 --> 00:38:11,329
Using my only daughter against me?

555
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,597
Harsh.

556
00:38:12,598 --> 00:38:20,105
I suppose I could've spent the next
500 years running, but for what?

557
00:38:20,106 --> 00:38:22,574
My daughter was dying.

558
00:38:22,575 --> 00:38:25,410
Stefan would never love me.

559
00:38:25,411 --> 00:38:28,980
I was back to having nothing.

560
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:30,314
Elena wins again.

561
00:38:30,316 --> 00:38:31,783
Let's get this over with.

562
00:38:31,784 --> 00:38:34,319
I'm really starting
to get sick of Elena

563
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,988
getting everything that I want.

564
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:39,317
What is that supposed to mean?

565
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:43,862
Wes had no intention...
of helping Nadia.

566
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,163
You can always run, Katherine.

567
00:38:45,164 --> 00:38:46,865
It's your choice.

568
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,298
Uhh!

569
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,042
A good day.

570
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,943
I've managed to extract
the werewolf venom

571
00:38:58,944 --> 00:39:00,779
from Nadia Petrova's blood.

572
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,814
The addition of the venom
will make the ripper virus

573
00:39:02,815 --> 00:39:05,383
even more lethal to vampires.

574
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,485
He was just using her

575
00:39:07,486 --> 00:39:08,820
as a case study in his project

576
00:39:08,821 --> 00:39:11,856
to wipe out vampires off
the face of the earth.

577
00:39:11,857 --> 00:39:13,525
Why are you telling me this?

578
00:39:16,694 --> 00:39:19,898
Hey. Elena?

579
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,167
I've said
it before and I'll say it again.

580
00:39:22,168 --> 00:39:25,703
Elena had the life
I always wanted. Heh.

581
00:39:25,704 --> 00:39:28,039
Well, until now.

582
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,374
Katherine, what did you do?

583
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:32,844
Stefan thought he gave me a choice:

584
00:39:32,845 --> 00:39:34,546
Run or die.

585
00:39:34,547 --> 00:39:37,314
But that's not really
much of a choice, is it?

586
00:39:38,883 --> 00:39:42,887
After all, Nadia was
the only person

587
00:39:42,888 --> 00:39:46,257
in this world who really loved me.

588
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:49,304
And I wasn't about to let
my daughter die alone.

589
00:39:50,929 --> 00:39:55,966
But Katherine Pierce wasn't
about to go gentle, either.

590
00:40:06,377 --> 00:40:07,611
Hi.

591
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,847
Are you... you?

592
00:40:12,951 --> 00:40:14,151
Yeah.

593
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:20,090
Yeah, it's me.
I'm here.

594
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:29,767
I left
Elena with a little bit of

595
00:40:29,768 --> 00:40:31,268
a parting gift.

596
00:40:33,738 --> 00:40:37,574
If I can't have Stefan,
then no one can.

597
00:40:40,778 --> 00:40:43,580
Ok. Now I'm ready.

598
00:40:59,197 --> 00:41:00,899
Nothing's happening.
What's wrong?

599
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,400
I don't know.
This has never happened before.

600
00:41:06,437 --> 00:41:08,006
Bonnie, what are you doing?

601
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,474
Let me pass through.

602
00:41:09,475 --> 00:41:11,309
Why won't you let me pass through?

603
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:14,344
I don't know.
I don't control it.

604
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,213
- What?
- It's not up to me.

605
00:41:17,549 --> 00:41:19,316
Then who is it up to?

606
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:39,336
- Bonnie.
- I can't help you, Katherine.

607
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,442
What... no, no no!

608
00:41:49,347 --> 00:41:50,480
Nooooo!

609
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,309
