00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:04,500
Previously on
"The Vampire Diaries"...

2
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:06,152
You have the ability
to keep living

3
00:00:06,153 --> 00:00:07,479
inside someone
else's body.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,667
Katherine Pierce
has permanent control

5
00:00:09,668 --> 00:00:10,858
of Elena Gilbert's body.

6
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:13,187
I want my daughter,
I want immortality,

7
00:00:13,188 --> 00:00:14,888
and I want
Stefan Salvatore.

8
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:16,924
I know how bad
I screwed up.

9
00:00:16,925 --> 00:00:18,058
I need you.

10
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,425
We're over.

11
00:00:21,328 --> 00:00:23,263
Why would Nadia
be compelling me?

12
00:00:23,264 --> 00:00:24,665
I need a crash course
on all things Elena Gilbert,

13
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,633
and I figured who
knows her better

14
00:00:26,634 --> 00:00:28,669
than her compellable
best friend?

15
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,031
So tell me, now that
you've slept with Klaus,

16
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:32,272
how was it?

17
00:00:32,273 --> 00:00:34,842
Oh, my God.

18
00:00:38,012 --> 00:00:39,179
And you are?

19
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,747
My backup.

20
00:00:40,748 --> 00:00:42,049
Wes has
this sick little scheme

21
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,570
to destroy vampires
by making them feed

22
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:44,920
on each other.

23
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,134
I can see how this
might be a problem.

24
00:01:13,713 --> 00:01:17,617
You think the fella
loved milking cows?

25
00:01:17,618 --> 00:01:19,538
Probably. Then she
became one,

26
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:22,188
so he drank himself
into oblivion,

27
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:24,001
she cheated
with the pastor.

28
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:25,892
Hey. Just because
you lost your true love

29
00:01:25,893 --> 00:01:27,394
doesn't mean you have to
dump on others.

30
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:28,795
There's no love in there.
Look at that picture.

31
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:30,397
It's old,

32
00:01:30,398 --> 00:01:32,009
and the milkmaid's
nowhere to be found.

33
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,901
It's just pathetic
old farmer John.

34
00:01:34,902 --> 00:01:39,272
Manners. It's impolite
to speak ill of our hosts.

35
00:01:39,273 --> 00:01:40,440
Doubt he'll mind.

36
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:43,476
Somebody's cranky.

37
00:01:43,477 --> 00:01:45,411
It's been almost 8 hours
since you last fed,

38
00:01:45,412 --> 00:01:47,280
so I suppose
that's about right.

39
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:48,481
You're timing me?

40
00:01:48,482 --> 00:01:50,350
You feed on vampires now.

41
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:51,451
I am a vampire.

42
00:01:51,452 --> 00:01:52,752
The only way to
assure my safety

43
00:01:52,753 --> 00:01:53,920
is to know how long
you can last

44
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:55,054
before your next fix.

45
00:01:55,055 --> 00:01:56,656
Or you can just
leave.

46
00:01:56,657 --> 00:01:58,891
I don't abandon
my friends, Damon.

47
00:01:58,892 --> 00:02:00,760
Besides, if you hadn't
come with me to kill Dr. Wes,

48
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:03,999
he wouldn't have stuck
you with that nasty virus.

49
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:06,418
Ah! Just in time.

50
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:07,544
Hello!

51
00:02:08,035 --> 00:02:09,369
What did you do?

52
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,470
What's happening?

53
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:11,838
Uh, you died,

54
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:14,140
but luckily, you had
my blood in your system,

55
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:15,842
so when you drink this,

56
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:17,888
you'll feel much better.

57
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:20,599
There you are.

58
00:02:21,048 --> 00:02:22,934
Good boy.

59
00:02:29,488 --> 00:02:30,690
What was that?

60
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:32,358
That was blood.
You're a vampire.

61
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:33,526
Congratulations.

62
00:02:33,527 --> 00:02:34,660
I'm a what?

63
00:02:34,661 --> 00:02:35,961
I know.
It's overwhelming,

64
00:02:35,962 --> 00:02:37,630
and Damon will explain
more in a bit,

65
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:39,465
but before he does,
settle a bet.

66
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:40,800
Your wife.
Where is she?

67
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:43,702
Wait. I drink blood now?

68
00:02:43,703 --> 00:02:45,304
Again, we'll explain
everything.

69
00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:46,605
Where's your wife?

70
00:02:46,606 --> 00:02:48,040
She's gone.
She left me years ago.

71
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,507
Pastor?

72
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,880
Pastor?

73
00:02:52,412 --> 00:02:54,280
Pharmacist.

74
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,650
Yes. I will take
that as a win for me,

75
00:02:57,651 --> 00:02:59,919
not for you.

76
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,945
Oh, stop trying
to scare me, Damon.

77
00:03:15,368 --> 00:03:18,703
I'm not leaving you.
I'm the only friend you have left.

78

79
00:03:30,682 --> 00:03:32,150
Roman empire.

80
00:03:32,151 --> 00:03:34,620
476 A.D. sacked
by the goths.

81
00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:35,620
Han dynasty.

82
00:03:35,955 --> 00:03:37,522
220 A.D.

83
00:03:37,523 --> 00:03:38,523
Holy Roman empire.

84
00:03:38,524 --> 00:03:41,693
Not really an empire,
but 1648.

85
00:03:41,694 --> 00:03:43,595
There goes
your perfect score.

86
00:03:43,596 --> 00:03:46,398
What? No.
That was right.

87
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:49,668
No, no, no.
The book says 1806.

88
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:52,671
Heh. Ok. Well, 1806 may
technically be right,

89
00:03:52,672 --> 00:03:54,573
but it was
the peace of Westphalia

90
00:03:54,574 --> 00:03:55,774
that truly ended
the empire,

91
00:03:55,775 --> 00:03:58,977
and that was in 1648.

92
00:03:58,978 --> 00:04:00,544
Trust me.

93
00:04:02,948 --> 00:04:04,883
I may have done
a paper

94
00:04:04,884 --> 00:04:07,118
on the holy Roman
empire in High School.

95
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:08,587
Well, if you want to
pass the test,

96
00:04:08,588 --> 00:04:10,422
I suggest you write down
exactly what's

97
00:04:10,423 --> 00:04:11,823
in your textbook.

98
00:04:13,226 --> 00:04:15,026
Oh. Caroline's here.

99
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:17,257
I asked the sheriff to
help me track down Damon.

100
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:22,967
You were right.
He's off the rails.

101
00:04:22,968 --> 00:04:24,536
This is from my mom.

102
00:04:24,537 --> 00:04:26,171
Let me guess...
Missing persons and animal attacks.

103
00:04:26,172 --> 00:04:27,639
Check and check.

104
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,207
There's
something else.

105
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,509
All the victims were
found inside their homes

106
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,244
without their head,

107
00:04:33,245 --> 00:04:35,579
and there skin
was desiccated.

108
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:42,240
Damon's feeding
on vampires.

109
00:04:46,057 --> 00:04:47,191
I shouldn't have
let him go.

110
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:48,793
No! Uh-uh. No!

111
00:04:48,794 --> 00:04:50,832
You are not turning
Damon's roosting chickens

112
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:53,625
into a Stefan Salvatore
guilt trip.

113
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,334
No one could have stopped him from
going after Wes the other night.

114
00:04:56,335 --> 00:04:58,089
Guess Wes must have
injected him

115
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,071
with whatever he was
gonna give Elena

116
00:05:00,072 --> 00:05:02,040
that makes vampires
feed on vampires.

117
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,508
Good news, bad news.

118
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:04,709
Bad news is that
when this happened to Jesse

119
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,877
we had to kill him,

120
00:05:05,878 --> 00:05:09,809
but the good news is...

121
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,406
I'm sorry. Usually
there's some good news.

122
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,588
I have to find him.

123
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:19,957
Well, I can come
with you.

124
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,492
Elena, hey!

125
00:05:21,493 --> 00:05:23,094
I didn't know
that you were here.

126
00:05:23,095 --> 00:05:24,929
Well, Stefan has been
helping me study.

127
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,285
Oh. Stefan who doesn't
go to college.

128
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,000
Stefan who's
an expert in history.

129
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,915
Uh-huh. Um...

130
00:05:32,404 --> 00:05:34,417
It's Tyler.

131
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,107
I haven't really
spoken to him

132
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:39,310
since, the, um,
incident.

133
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:41,011
The incident?
You mean the time

134
00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:43,046
where he
almost killed you?

135
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:46,450
Hey.

136
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:47,885
Hey, have you
talked to Matt?

137
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,520
No. Why?

138
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:50,921
Because it turns out
Nadia's been compelling

139
00:05:50,922 --> 00:05:52,790
him to forget things.

140
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,058
Matt said he was
gonna avoid her,

141
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:55,659
but now I haven't
heard from him.

142
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,227
Do you think that
he's in trouble?

143
00:05:57,228 --> 00:05:58,662
He hasn't been home
or at work,

144
00:05:58,663 --> 00:06:00,130
and his cell phone goes
straight to voicemail.

145
00:06:00,131 --> 00:06:02,132
Ok. Well, I'll come
right over and...

146
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:03,300
No. That's not
why I called.

147
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:04,635
No. I know,
but I think that

148
00:06:04,636 --> 00:06:06,537
we can figure
this out together.

149
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:09,373
I'll see you soon.

150
00:06:09,374 --> 00:06:10,507
Maybe I should
come with you.

151
00:06:10,508 --> 00:06:12,176
No. No. You deal
with Damon.

152
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,877
We can handle this.

153
00:06:13,878 --> 00:06:15,079
Besides, it's time that
we move into the next phase

154
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,714
of our post-breakup,
pre-friendship

155
00:06:17,715 --> 00:06:19,016
relationship timeline.

156
00:06:19,017 --> 00:06:21,318
Ok. I'm gonna stay
out that one.

157
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,687
I'm gonna get
some clothes,

158
00:06:23,688 --> 00:06:25,589
and you'll pick me up
at my dorm?

159
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,847
Sure.

160
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:31,094
Bad news is
Tyler hates you,

161
00:06:31,095 --> 00:06:34,769
but the good news
is... hmm.

162
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,700
It'll be fine.

163
00:06:36,701 --> 00:06:41,538
We both have weird
ex... friend situations.

164
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:43,573
We? There's nothing
weird going on

165
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:44,975
between Elena
and me.

166
00:06:44,976 --> 00:06:46,543
Come on, Stefan!

167
00:06:46,544 --> 00:06:47,711
First she tells you
that she's gonna fight

168
00:06:47,712 --> 00:06:48,912
to get Damon back,

169
00:06:48,913 --> 00:06:50,547
and then she rebreaks up
with him,

170
00:06:50,548 --> 00:06:54,551
and now she's here
with you, her ex, studying?

171
00:06:54,552 --> 00:06:57,876
She's here with
her friend studying

172
00:06:57,877 --> 00:07:00,045
without the implied
quotes.

173
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:03,326
Look. I'm just saying that
Elena and Damon's breakup

174
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:04,299
is messy,

175
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,801
and you are not messy.

176
00:07:07,231 --> 00:07:09,766
You're stable
and sane and...

177
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:11,901
And I'm about to spend 12
hours in a car with her alone,

178
00:07:11,902 --> 00:07:13,770
so whatever
she's feeling

179
00:07:13,771 --> 00:07:17,604
I'm sure I'll be able
to figure it out.

180
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:20,777
What's going on
with Matt?

181
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:22,025
Nothing.

182
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:23,747
Really? Because
Goldilocks

183
00:07:23,748 --> 00:07:25,248
and the big bad wolf
are meeting to powwow

184
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,613
about him as we speak.

185
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:31,284
Fine. Matt found out
about you.

186
00:07:31,856 --> 00:07:32,735
He what?!

187
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:36,292
Tyler gave him
vervain.

188
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:37,360
Kill him.

189
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:38,595
Katherine!

190
00:07:38,596 --> 00:07:39,662
Kill him now.

191
00:07:39,663 --> 00:07:41,130
He doesn't need
to die.

192
00:07:41,131 --> 00:07:42,732
The vervain will be
out of his system soon,

193
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:44,233
and I've kept him out
of sight for two days,

194
00:07:44,234 --> 00:07:45,802
so he hasn't
told anyone.

195
00:07:45,803 --> 00:07:48,259
So you two have just been
tucked away, canoodling?

196
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:50,506
I don't even know
what that means.

197
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:52,075
We all love Matt Donovan.

198
00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:54,307
Otherwise, he would have
been dead a long time ago,

199
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:57,113
but when it comes to keeping
my new doppelganger body

200
00:07:57,114 --> 00:08:00,522
a secret,
nobody is that important.

201
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:03,486
I am going out of town
with Stefan

202
00:08:03,487 --> 00:08:05,555
because he wants to
find Damon.

203
00:08:05,556 --> 00:08:08,291
I thought you wanted
Damon out of the picture.

204
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,359
Meh. I do,

205
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,595
but I saw an opportunity
to be alone with Stefan

206
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:16,162
for a few days,
and, well, I took it.

207
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:19,235
And what happens when
you get too close,

208
00:08:19,236 --> 00:08:20,369
too comfortable?

209
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,771
What happens
when you slip up?

210
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:24,507
Will you kill
your precious Stefan, too?

211
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:27,443
Using my own words
against me.

212
00:08:27,444 --> 00:08:28,878
Now that's
a Petrova specialty.

213
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,179
Take care
of the Matt issue

214
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,647
before I get back
into town,

215
00:08:31,648 --> 00:08:33,515
or I'll have to
do it myself.

216
00:08:35,718 --> 00:08:36,808
It'll be fine.

217
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,144
I just need to convince
my friends that I'm ok.

218
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:41,056
I'll keep your secret.

219
00:08:41,057 --> 00:08:43,792
No one has to die.

220
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:49,164
Relax.

221
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:50,530
Heh heh heh.

222
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,334
I'm not going to
syrup you to death.

223
00:08:58,515 --> 00:08:59,873
What's canoodling?

224
00:09:05,882 --> 00:09:08,250
I didn't realize you
liked to play with dolls.

225
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:11,019
Well, my brother likes
to make a big show,

226
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,421
set them up,
put their heads back on,

227
00:09:12,422 --> 00:09:13,922
pretend like
it didn't happen.

228
00:09:13,923 --> 00:09:16,892
I, on the other hand,
don't give a crap.

229
00:09:16,893 --> 00:09:20,963
Well, we've got 8 hours
till you need to feed again.

230
00:09:20,964 --> 00:09:24,866
I wonder,
what's New York like these days.

231
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:25,982
Crowded.

232
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,403
Perfect. Let's go.

233
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:32,641
Oh, what is that?

234
00:09:32,642 --> 00:09:35,911
It's the obnoxious theme
song of the travelers.

235
00:09:39,948 --> 00:09:41,750
Unh!

236
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:43,752
Aww.

237
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:51,927
As a man of science,
I always considered

238
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:53,092
magic a cheat.

239
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:56,398
Turns out I cheat.

240
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,799
How's the appetite?

241
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,849
Funny you should ask.
I was just craving a blond.

242
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:01,684
You're my patient zero,
Damon.

243
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:03,738
Couldn't let you ride
off into the sunseting a blond.

244
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:05,440
Without running
a few tests.

245
00:10:05,441 --> 00:10:06,574
A few tests.

246
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:07,732
Well, one test.

247
00:10:08,244 --> 00:10:10,745
Now that you're trapped
with only one source of food,

248
00:10:10,746 --> 00:10:14,081
how long can you go before
you feed on your best friend?

249
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,497
You ever think
about getting a new car?

250
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:32,732
What are you
talking about?

251
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:33,967
This car's
a classic.

252
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:36,202
Yeah, and so is,
uh, Wright brothers' plane,

253
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:39,472
but you don't see people still
flying around in that thing.

254
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,440
You know, uh...

255
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,876
I appreciate you
being here,

256
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,395
but you didn't
have to come.

257
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:48,231
I told you
I'm doing this for you

258
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:51,083
because you're still
holding on to the hope

259
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:55,221
that maybe this is the time
that Damon can be saved.

260
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,389
And you don't think
he can?

261
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,226
Look. I know that he crossed
a line with Jeremy,

262
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:03,371
but, you know,
he's crossed many lines before.

263
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,831
You mean, when he
actually killed Jeremy?

264
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,366
Yes, I recall.

265
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,935
I'm just saying
you've never really

266
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:11,921
closed him off
like this before.

267
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:16,342
I mean, obviously,
I still care about Damon.

268
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,135
I guess I got my hopes up
too many times.

269
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,979
I want off the emotional
roller coaster

270
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,648
that is Damon's redemption.

271
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,950
You know, it's just...
It's dizzying.

272
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:29,397
Are you hungry?
Because I'm starving.

273
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:32,357
Um, sure.
What do you want?

274
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,425
Whatever you're having

275
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,960
but with a lot more salt

276
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,296
and maybe covered
in chocolate.

277
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,629
Coming right up.

278
00:12:12,597 --> 00:12:14,432
Give it up, mate.

279
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,535
Those travelers sealed
this whole place up tight.

280
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:17,869
The spell can't
last forever.

281
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,638
Doesn't need to.
Wes only needs it

282
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,199
to last 8 hours,
remember?

283
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,774
Then he can come
back inside

284
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:25,076
and autopsy
my mangled corpse.

285
00:12:32,132 --> 00:12:34,045
You're pretty zen
about all this.

286
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:36,631
Did you forget everything
I taught you in that cell?

287
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:40,841
Calmer heads
will always prevail.

288
00:12:40,842 --> 00:12:42,775
Always the solider.

289
00:12:44,645 --> 00:12:47,414
But you do have people
we can call,

290
00:12:47,415 --> 00:12:49,894
like your brother
or your ex,

291
00:12:50,418 --> 00:12:52,605
who can in turn find Wes
and threaten him

292
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,254
or maim him

293
00:12:54,255 --> 00:12:55,722
or anything that doesn't
involve your fangs

294
00:12:55,723 --> 00:12:57,090
on my neck.

295
00:12:57,091 --> 00:12:59,126
My brother told me
to leave and not come back.

296
00:12:59,127 --> 00:13:00,427
I'm not calling him.

297
00:13:00,428 --> 00:13:01,828
So my life is not
worth your pride?

298
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:03,030
They won't come.

299
00:13:03,031 --> 00:13:04,742
Or they will.

300
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:07,367
Then you might
hurt them.

301
00:13:07,368 --> 00:13:09,330
Don't want to
risk, do you?

302
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,082
Me on the other hand...

303
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:15,044
I'm not gonna
feed on you.

304
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,838
I'll find another way.

305
00:13:28,488 --> 00:13:30,022
Thank you.

306
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:40,153
Mmm. That's
good coffee.

307
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:42,068
Although I usually
take mine

308
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:44,904
with a little more
awkward silence.

309
00:13:44,905 --> 00:13:46,106
Nice try,
but you don't take

310
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:48,540
anything with silence.

311
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,346
So Matt.
He's missing?

312
00:13:53,347 --> 00:13:54,714
I don't know
if he's missing.

313
00:13:54,715 --> 00:13:56,349
He just hasn't
been home in two days,

314
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,584
and he's not
answering his phone.

315
00:13:59,953 --> 00:14:02,884
Matt?

316
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:05,491
Caroline!
What are you doing here?

317
00:14:05,492 --> 00:14:07,093
Kind of wondering
the same thing.

318
00:14:07,094 --> 00:14:08,861
Where the hell
have you been?

319
00:14:08,862 --> 00:14:11,682
Did I give you
my sunglasses?

320
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:14,312
Oh. Hello.

321
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:17,670
I thought you said
they wouldn't be home.

322
00:14:17,671 --> 00:14:19,839
Ok.
Rewind. Start over.

323
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,901
This whole time you've
been with Nadia?

324
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,362
It's a long story.

325
00:14:23,911 --> 00:14:27,283
Nadia, come on in.

326
00:14:27,815 --> 00:14:28,814
Hmm.

327
00:14:30,216 --> 00:14:32,584
Oh, man.

328
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:36,122
Hey. Can you hold this
for a second?

329
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:37,290
Yeah.

330
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,591
Careful. It has
grease on it.

331
00:14:38,592 --> 00:14:39,892
Oh, ok.

332
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:41,294
I have no idea how
this hose ripped out,

333
00:14:41,295 --> 00:14:42,562
but we're not gonna
be able to go anywhere

334
00:14:42,563 --> 00:14:45,197
until I get a new one.

335
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:48,934
I guess I'll see if
that mechanic has a spare.

336
00:14:51,737 --> 00:14:54,640
You weren't careful
at all?

337
00:14:54,641 --> 00:14:56,437
What? What?

338
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,844
Ohh! I love this shirt.

339
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:00,983
You loved that shirt.

340
00:15:01,548 --> 00:15:05,905
Great. Awesome
that's just awesome.

341
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:08,906
Now there's grease
all over your face.

342
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:11,617
Ugh!

343
00:15:11,618 --> 00:15:14,914
Well, you've got all that
engine stuff on you,

344
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:18,464
and I clearly
have to change.

345
00:15:18,465 --> 00:15:21,800
I saw a hotel, like,
a couple streets down that way.

346
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:23,535
Do you think
we should get a room

347
00:15:23,536 --> 00:15:27,009
so that we can shower while
we're waiting for the car?

348
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:30,442
No. I should probably stay
here in case they finish early,

349
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:31,944
but you can go.

350
00:15:31,945 --> 00:15:33,599
Give them
your phone number.

351
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,147
I assume that your phone
does receive

352
00:15:35,148 --> 00:15:36,515
incoming calls, right?

353
00:15:36,516 --> 00:15:37,716
Or is it
from the Han dynasty

354
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:38,980
just like your car?

355
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:40,022
That's funny.

356
00:15:43,455 --> 00:15:45,223
Will you grab my bag?

357
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:53,965
Sure.
Be right there.

358
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:01,706
I was on my way
out of town,

359
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:02,907
and then there
she was,

360
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:04,676
sitting
on the front steps,

361
00:16:04,677 --> 00:16:06,411
waiting for me.

362
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:08,801
Subtlety's not
my strong suit.

363
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,549
I felt bad
about compelling him

364
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,518
and bad about snapping
your neck.

365
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,766
Again, subtlety.

366
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,954
So why haven't you
been answering your phone?

367
00:16:17,955 --> 00:16:19,353
Uh, I lost it
the first night.

368
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,626
- First night where?
- Atlantic city.

369
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:23,107
I'd never been,
neither had Matt.

370
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,763
1 drink led to 3
and to 5

371
00:16:25,764 --> 00:16:27,665
and then, uh...

372
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:28,933
The rest is
kind of a blur.

373
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:30,654
Yeah, because she's
compelling you!

374
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:32,503
Caroline, I'm
wearing vervain.

375
00:16:32,504 --> 00:16:35,306
She's not
compelling me.

376
00:16:35,307 --> 00:16:36,871
Where have you been
the last two days?

377
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:38,915
I told you. She's
not compelling me.

378
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:39,957
We're having fun.

379
00:16:40,145 --> 00:16:42,113
Oh. Fun!

380
00:16:42,114 --> 00:16:43,586
Just like the time
she buried you alive!

381
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,838
Whoo! Pop open
the champagne!

382
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,486
I thought you said she'd be
cool with us hanging out.

383
00:16:48,487 --> 00:16:50,424
And what the hell is
that supposed to mean?

384
00:16:50,425 --> 00:16:51,522
Uh...

385
00:16:51,523 --> 00:16:54,025
It means you've done
nothing but judge Matt

386
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:55,426
since he walked
through that door

387
00:16:55,427 --> 00:16:56,961
when everyone here knows
you're not exactly

388
00:16:56,962 --> 00:17:00,131
winning friends
with your romantic choices.

389
00:17:00,132 --> 00:17:02,833
Isn't that right, Tyler?

390
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:04,868
I don't want to
be a part of this.

391
00:17:11,342 --> 00:17:14,845
She's just trying to get
under our skin to distract us.

392
00:17:14,846 --> 00:17:16,327
From what?

393
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:17,828
This is Matt we're
talking about.

394
00:17:18,116 --> 00:17:19,984
Did you forget that time
he went to Europe with Rebekah

395
00:17:19,985 --> 00:17:21,664
after she ran
his truck off the road?

396
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,989
You're not seriously
buying all this?

397
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,223
Hell of a lot easier
to buy

398
00:17:26,224 --> 00:17:28,297
than other things
that have happened.

399
00:17:42,973 --> 00:17:47,244
So what did you do,
bring your entire closet?

400
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:51,048
Well, I didn't know
how long we'd be gone,

401
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:52,349
and let's be honest.

402
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,217
Damon's spirals require
a little more

403
00:17:54,218 --> 00:17:55,786
than an overnight bag.

404
00:17:55,787 --> 00:17:57,220
Mm-hmm.

405
00:17:57,221 --> 00:17:58,588
We'll get him back.

406
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:01,163
He's, uh... he's hurt,
but he's not a lost cause.

407
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,707
What makes you
think that?

408
00:18:03,194 --> 00:18:04,461
Because I know what
he's going through.

409
00:18:04,462 --> 00:18:05,584
What do you mean?

410
00:18:08,298 --> 00:18:12,202
You don't know what it's
like being in love with you.

411
00:18:12,203 --> 00:18:14,604
You know,
when you and I were together,

412
00:18:14,605 --> 00:18:18,008
every single atom
in my body told me

413
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:19,509
that it was
the right thing,

414
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,745
that we were
the perfect fit,

415
00:18:21,746 --> 00:18:22,913
and that kind
of love,

416
00:18:22,914 --> 00:18:25,715
it can change
your whole life,

417
00:18:25,716 --> 00:18:27,117
and then when somebody
who made you feel that way

418
00:18:27,118 --> 00:18:29,108
suddenly stops,

419
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:33,957
the vacuum
is just...

420
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:37,060
I get it.

421
00:18:37,061 --> 00:18:40,864
They built a whole
prophecy around it.

422
00:18:40,865 --> 00:18:42,265
He's not handling
it right,

423
00:18:42,266 --> 00:18:44,566
but he's not gone.

424
00:18:47,737 --> 00:18:49,744
You need a refill.

425
00:18:57,247 --> 00:18:59,415
I should go wash up.

426
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,983
Ok.

427
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,529
Towing chains.
Farmer's best friend.

428
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,299
In about an hour, mine.

429
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,999
Take a seat.

430
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,840
They're not gonna let us out
of here until I kill you...

431
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:25,508
Or you kill me.

432
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:28,000
Don't be dramatic.

433
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,752
We'll work
something out.

434
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,548
There's no cure,
Enzo, not for this.

435
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,217
You've given it all
of two days.

436
00:19:38,754 --> 00:19:40,623
That's what you do,
isn't it?

437
00:19:40,624 --> 00:19:42,158
There's a problem,
you run.

438
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:43,626
You did it to me,

439
00:19:43,627 --> 00:19:45,027
you did it
to your girl.

440
00:19:45,028 --> 00:19:47,495
Because when I stay,
I destroy things.

441
00:19:54,103 --> 00:19:56,905
We're not all as fragile
as you think we are.

442
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:04,813
What the hell
are you doing?

443
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:06,453
Calling for backup.

444
00:20:06,454 --> 00:20:08,414
I thought I told
you not call them.

445
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,001
And I told you your pride isn't
worth either of our lives.

446
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,638
Oh, my God. Damon?

447
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:31,540
Hello, Stefan.
How wonderful to hear

448
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,440
your beautiful
feminine voice.

449
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:36,402
Enzo. What the hell
do you want?

450
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,987
I'm in a spot
of trouble actually.

451
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:38,988
Where's Damon?

452
00:20:39,249 --> 00:20:41,031
Oh, he's here,
salivating,

453
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,751
about to chomp
into my neck and feed

454
00:20:42,752 --> 00:20:44,786
until my head pops off
in a grotesque

455
00:20:44,787 --> 00:20:47,889
but slightly
comical fashion.

456
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,758
Wes infected him?

457
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,161
You know about the virus.
Good. We could use a hand.

458
00:20:53,162 --> 00:20:55,063
Wes enlisted some
of those singing witches

459
00:20:55,064 --> 00:20:56,628
and trapped us
in the house.

460
00:20:56,629 --> 00:20:59,735
Do not come here!

461
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:01,770
He doesn't want to
risk feeding on you.

462
00:21:01,771 --> 00:21:03,438
That's sweet really,
but you'll be fine.

463
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:04,673
Besides if he does
feed on you,

464
00:21:04,674 --> 00:21:06,474
I have orders
to kill him.

465
00:21:08,877 --> 00:21:11,437
Ok. Um,
text me the address to my phone,

466
00:21:12,014 --> 00:21:14,282
and we'll be there
as soon as we can.

467
00:21:14,283 --> 00:21:16,551
Fine. And, uh, ticktock.

468
00:21:16,552 --> 00:21:17,786
I managed
to restrain him,

469
00:21:17,787 --> 00:21:19,120
but you know how persistent
Damon can be

470
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:20,388
when he wants something.

471
00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:21,906
We'll be there soon.

472
00:21:23,925 --> 00:21:24,992
You say something?

473
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:27,127
No. Heh.

474
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:36,204
It'll be all right, mate.

475
00:21:36,205 --> 00:21:37,605
They'll come,
and we'll sort something out.

476
00:21:37,606 --> 00:21:39,174
Or they'll come,
and I'll feed on them.

477
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:40,408
Those are also options.

478
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:41,926
As long as I live,
I'm good.

479
00:21:42,478 --> 00:21:44,179
Joking. Kind of.

480
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,850
If you were aiming for my heart,
you missed.

481
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:51,519
Don't worry.
I wasn't.

482
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,820
Chains were a good idea.

483
00:21:52,821 --> 00:21:54,480
Now I can see exactly
how strong he becomes

484
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:56,189
when enraged.

485
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:05,991
Conclusion... very strong.

486
00:22:11,806 --> 00:22:13,708
Boy, do I miss
that indestructible Augustine cage

487
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:15,042
right about now.

488
00:22:18,913 --> 00:22:21,048
Damon, stop! Damon, stop!

489
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:24,384
Stop! Please, Damon, stop!

490
00:22:30,923 --> 00:22:33,018
Damon, stop!
Stop, please!

491
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:37,355
Damon! Aah! Aah!

492
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:46,490
What did you do
to him?

493
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:49,001
My friends here raised
the acidity of your blood.

494
00:22:49,002 --> 00:22:51,170
There must be some
witchy explanation for it,

495
00:22:51,171 --> 00:22:53,439
but Damon's basically
drinking hydrochloric acid.

496
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,791
I suggest you leave
before the spell wears off.

497
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,843
And go where...
With you?

498
00:22:57,844 --> 00:23:00,045
There's one more thing
I need from you.

499
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,581
Then I'll let you go
for good.

500
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:04,583
The other option is
to stay in here

501
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:08,087
with your cannibal friend
and see how long you last.

502
00:23:08,088 --> 00:23:10,089
Go, Enzo!

503
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:13,926
I tried to kill you.
I'll do it again.

504
00:23:13,927 --> 00:23:15,994
Go, Enzo!

505
00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:37,748
Car's done.

506
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,586
I'll be right there.

507
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,575
Hey, um...

508
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:05,526
Would mind grabbing
me my shirt?

509
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,446
It's the... the green
one right on top.

510
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,847
Yeah, sure.

511
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,691
Thanks.

512
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:21,291
Yeah.

513
00:26:04,027 --> 00:26:06,190
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

514
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,276
This is...
This is wrong.

515
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:11,568
We, uh...

516
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:12,988
You and Damon
just split up.

517
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:15,906
You don't have to,
um... you're right.

518
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:20,344
I'm... I'm sorry.
I was just in the moment.

519
00:26:21,954 --> 00:26:24,208
I shouldn't have.

520
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,551
Yeah.

521
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,653
We have a long night
ahead of us,

522
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:31,188
so maybe we should...

523
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:34,758
Yeah. Um, you know what?

524
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,893
Why don't you go, um,
settle up the bill,

525
00:26:36,894 --> 00:26:39,328
and I'll... I'll
finish packing?

526
00:27:00,517 --> 00:27:02,017
Heh.

527
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:11,213
Who do you think
Stefan loves more,

528
00:27:11,662 --> 00:27:13,863
Damon or Elena?

529
00:27:13,864 --> 00:27:15,217
Why are you
calling me?

530
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:18,468
Damon has been infected
by the ripper virus,

531
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:20,389
and I know exactly
where he is,

532
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:23,773
so if I can get Damon
to attack me,

533
00:27:23,774 --> 00:27:28,230
the only way to save me would
be for Stefan to kill him.

534
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:30,899
You're going to make
Stefan kill his brother?

535
00:27:31,415 --> 00:27:33,750
Dark, even for you.

536
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:35,218
Thank you.

537
00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:37,587
So how goes it
with Matty blue eyes?

538
00:27:37,588 --> 00:27:38,721
Dead yet?

539
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:40,075
Still working on it.

540
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:43,592
Good luck with your plan
to win Stefan's love.

541
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,460
So... I'm curious.

542
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,368
We spent a few days
together now.

543
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:53,603
Canoodling?

544
00:27:53,604 --> 00:27:56,038
Canoodling. Exactly.

545
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,007
It seems like you went
through all this trouble

546
00:27:58,008 --> 00:28:02,578
to save your mom, but she only
seems interested in Stefan.

547
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:03,640
That's Katherine.

548
00:28:04,214 --> 00:28:07,216
I didn't expect
mother-daughter boozy brunches.

549
00:28:07,217 --> 00:28:09,085
Yeah, but you did
expect something.

550
00:28:09,086 --> 00:28:10,753
Are you going to play
a card or what?

551
00:28:10,754 --> 00:28:12,488
Look. I've been
where you are.

552
00:28:12,489 --> 00:28:14,523
My mom used to disappear
for weeks at a time

553
00:28:14,524 --> 00:28:16,067
and then show up one
day out of the blue

554
00:28:16,068 --> 00:28:17,326
like nothing
happened.

555
00:28:17,327 --> 00:28:18,527
Before you knew it,
I'd be at the stove,

556
00:28:18,528 --> 00:28:19,995
making her
a grilled cheese.

557
00:28:19,996 --> 00:28:21,464
This isn't like that.

558
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:24,033
Isn't it?
She decides when you're worth it

559
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:26,368
on her watch,
but guess what.

560
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:27,703
You're never gonna
be as interesting

561
00:28:27,704 --> 00:28:30,573
as the next guy she
wants to sleep with.

562
00:28:30,574 --> 00:28:34,043
Matt, you'd say
anything to help Elena.

563
00:28:34,044 --> 00:28:35,277
I'm not an idiot.

564
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:36,612
You are if you think
that Katherine's

565
00:28:36,613 --> 00:28:40,316
gonna choose you...
Because she's not.

566
00:28:40,317 --> 00:28:43,472
Do you know why you found yourself
making all those sandwiches?

567
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:46,431
Because the second your mom
walked back into your life,

568
00:28:46,432 --> 00:28:48,477
you forgot all those
horrible things that she did

569
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:51,160
because at the end
of the day,

570
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:53,495
she's still your mom,

571
00:28:53,496 --> 00:28:55,897
2and you love her.

572
00:28:59,535 --> 00:29:01,469
Give me your wrist.

573
00:29:11,914 --> 00:29:13,916
The vervain is gone.

574
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:15,212
Our fun is over.

575
00:29:15,213 --> 00:29:17,552
Wait.

576
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:20,321
Since I'm gonna
forget this anyway...

577
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:30,769
What was that for?

578
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:33,034
Thank you.

579
00:29:33,035 --> 00:29:34,936
If I'm gonna be threatened
and held against my will,

580
00:29:34,937 --> 00:29:38,038
I could think
of worse scenarios.

581
00:30:06,801 --> 00:30:08,202
What the hell?

582
00:30:13,653 --> 00:30:15,634
What'd you expect?
Elena's my best friend.

583
00:30:15,635 --> 00:30:17,789
I'll always protect her.

584
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,357
It just sucks.

585
00:30:19,358 --> 00:30:21,493
You were the only decent
person in this town.

586
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:25,532
And I still am,
and so are you.

587
00:30:26,031 --> 00:30:28,599
You could have killed me
this morning, and you didn't.

588
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,968
You're not like her,
and you know it.

589
00:30:35,239 --> 00:30:38,126
Forget everything you're
not supposed to know.

590
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,711
We partied,
we slept together,

591
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,345
then I left.

592
00:30:41,346 --> 00:30:42,345
Good-bye.

593
00:30:50,988 --> 00:30:53,767
Going somewhere?

594
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,813
Actually, I am,
and you're in my way.

595
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:59,163
Matt, are you ok?

596
00:30:59,164 --> 00:31:00,831
Yeah. Why?
What's going on in here?

597
00:31:00,832 --> 00:31:05,320
You texted me
from Nadia's phone.

598
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,989
So you compelled
him again.

599
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,827
And they say blonds
are dumb.

600
00:31:11,243 --> 00:31:14,623
What are you doing to him? Tell me!

601
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:15,845
Nadia, stop!

602
00:31:15,846 --> 00:31:17,648
You may not
remember, Matt,

603
00:31:17,649 --> 00:31:19,316
but this is
your fault.

604
00:31:19,317 --> 00:31:21,087
Trust me.

605
00:31:24,488 --> 00:31:27,223
Young hybrid beats
old vampire every time!

606
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:37,167
Wait a second!
Does anyone want to tell me

607
00:31:37,168 --> 00:31:39,435
how this is
my fault?

608
00:31:50,914 --> 00:31:52,448
Elena.

609
00:31:56,242 --> 00:31:57,854
Don't.

610
00:31:57,855 --> 00:31:59,889
Do not.

611
00:32:02,292 --> 00:32:04,494
I said don't!

612
00:32:04,495 --> 00:32:06,631
You come in here,
you ain't coming out.

613
00:32:06,632 --> 00:32:08,176
What exactly
happened here?

614
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:11,034
I wanted revenge,

615
00:32:11,035 --> 00:32:12,336
got stuck with
the vampire virus,

616
00:32:12,337 --> 00:32:15,138
almost killed
my last friend.

617
00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:16,768
Typical Damon.

618
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:19,976
Enzo texted me
the address here.

619
00:32:19,977 --> 00:32:21,771
Damon, we're here
to help you.

620
00:32:21,772 --> 00:32:22,878
You can't help me.

621
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:24,399
I feed on
vampires now.

622
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,861
You're
both vampires.

623
00:32:25,862 --> 00:32:28,071
Do yourselves
a favor and leave.

624
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:30,866
Well, that's not
gonna happen.

625
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:33,056
Stay back!

626
00:32:33,617 --> 00:32:35,758
I'm not afraid
of you, Damon.

627
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:57,613
Neither am I.

628
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:04,253
You better get out.

629
00:33:08,925 --> 00:33:10,926
What the hell is
wrong with you?

630
00:33:13,863 --> 00:33:17,913
I'm proving to you that you're
not a lost cause, Damon.

631
00:33:28,478 --> 00:33:29,979
Elena.

632
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,981
See?

633
00:33:31,982 --> 00:33:33,348
Ugh!

634
00:33:34,784 --> 00:33:38,020
Damon, you can
resist this.

635
00:33:38,021 --> 00:33:41,257
You can do it. Why?
Because you love me,

636
00:33:41,258 --> 00:33:45,994
and that love is stronger
than any craving.

637
00:33:47,864 --> 00:33:49,131
Get away from me,
Elena.

638
00:33:49,132 --> 00:33:50,666
Elena, he's gonna
kill you.

639
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:52,155
No. No.
He's not going to.

640
00:33:52,669 --> 00:33:54,437
He's not going to.

641
00:33:54,438 --> 00:33:56,973
You can do this, Damon.
Fight it.

642
00:33:56,974 --> 00:33:58,908
There you go.
Turn around.

643
00:34:05,581 --> 00:34:08,384
There you go.

644
00:34:08,385 --> 00:34:09,852
Aah!

645
00:34:09,853 --> 00:34:11,287
Damon, stop!

646
00:34:11,288 --> 00:34:13,255
Damon, let go of her,
let go of her!

647
00:34:13,256 --> 00:34:14,490
Stefan!

648
00:34:14,491 --> 00:34:16,324
Let go!

649
00:34:19,528 --> 00:34:21,935
No! He's going...

650
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:23,865
To kill me!

651
00:34:29,071 --> 00:34:30,406
Here, Damon.
Look over here.

652
00:34:30,407 --> 00:34:34,510
You smell that?
Feed on me, not her.

653
00:34:34,511 --> 00:34:36,032
That's good.
That's good.

654
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:37,784
Feed on me.

655
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,782
Well, the only
thing Matt remembers

656
00:34:59,783 --> 00:35:02,318
is that they
slept together.

657
00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:04,319
Well...

658
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,941
So...

659
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:15,564
Care.

660
00:35:15,565 --> 00:35:17,599
I never said sorry.

661
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,903
I was pissed,
but...

662
00:35:20,904 --> 00:35:24,706
No excuses, ok?

663
00:35:24,707 --> 00:35:27,676
Look. We can get
past this together.

664
00:35:27,677 --> 00:35:31,113
Ok? I just want us to
be good again, you know?

665
00:35:31,114 --> 00:35:32,814
I said I was sorry.

666
00:35:32,815 --> 00:35:34,316
I didn't say
I was past it.

667
00:35:34,317 --> 00:35:36,341
Of course.
Obviously.

668
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,519
I mean, Rome wasn't
built in a day.

669
00:35:40,656 --> 00:35:43,592
How evolved do you
think I am?

670
00:35:43,593 --> 00:35:46,267
You slept with Klaus.

671
00:35:46,268 --> 00:35:48,396
You slept with the guy
that killed my mom.

672
00:35:48,965 --> 00:35:52,150
What's a fair amount of time
for me to get past that?

673
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:54,569
A week, a month?

674
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,837
Tell me. What sounds
right to you?

675
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:59,697
Ok. You made
your point.

676
00:35:59,698 --> 00:36:02,492
Look. I'm not
trying to be a dick,

677
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,411
but the idea
of us being good,

678
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,447
it's not gonna happen.

679
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,836
Understood.

680
00:36:34,608 --> 00:36:36,736
Ugh.

681
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:39,614
I know you can't
help yourself,

682
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:41,216
but if you bring
home a rabid animal,

683
00:36:41,217 --> 00:36:43,493
you're gonna
get bit.

684
00:36:45,354 --> 00:36:47,205
Never should have
told you to leave.

685
00:36:47,756 --> 00:36:49,389
Uh!

686
00:36:51,693 --> 00:36:54,127
I'm gonna kill you,
Stefan.

687
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,030
Maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow,

688
00:36:56,031 --> 00:36:58,299
but at some point
I'm gonna rip open up your throat,

689
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,425
and you're
gonna die.

690
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,570
Oh, come on, Damon.

691
00:37:02,571 --> 00:37:04,595
You think I'm afraid
of a ripper?

692
00:37:04,596 --> 00:37:06,340
Who do you think
invented the word?

693
00:37:06,341 --> 00:37:08,176
You know that feeling you get
when you're around vampire blood,

694
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,518
that burning
in your veins?

695
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,729
I feel that
on a daily basis,

696
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,315
and there's a way
to control it.

697
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:15,583
And let me guess...

698
00:37:15,584 --> 00:37:17,118
It'd bring you
no greater pleasure

699
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,552
than to teach me.

700
00:37:18,553 --> 00:37:20,187
No. It's a good guess,
but right now,

701
00:37:20,188 --> 00:37:22,223
I'm gonna go get you
a little bit more vervain,

702
00:37:22,224 --> 00:37:25,159
and them I'm gonna
have a drink,

703
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,395
and I'm gonna let you think about
what a royal pain in the ass

704
00:37:27,396 --> 00:37:29,873
you've been lately.

705
00:37:30,298 --> 00:37:32,433
You're my brother.

706
00:37:32,434 --> 00:37:35,536
I'm not gonna
give up on you.

707
00:37:35,537 --> 00:37:37,405
I never will.

708
00:37:37,406 --> 00:37:39,239
She has.

709
00:37:41,976 --> 00:37:43,309
You talking about Elena?

710
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,411
Mm-hmm.

711
00:37:44,412 --> 00:37:45,779
She practically got
herself killed

712
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,047
to prove a point today.

713
00:37:47,048 --> 00:37:48,682
You remember the vampire
ripper Jesse?

714
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,102
When he attacked me,
Elena had to kill him,

715
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:53,220
but if there was
the slightest chance

716
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:54,741
that there was
another way to stop him,

717
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,991
she would have taken it.

718
00:37:56,992 --> 00:37:58,692
Yeah, so?

719
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,861
She knew it would be impossible
for me to resist her blood,

720
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,429
and then she just
kicked you a stake

721
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:06,700
and essentially told
you to kill me.

722
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,636
So what are you saying?
You saying that Elena

723
00:38:09,637 --> 00:38:12,040
wanted me to kill you?

724
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:15,808
You got another
excuse, hmm?

725
00:38:28,121 --> 00:38:29,822
That's what I thought.

726
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,810
Well...

727
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:53,480
I could use a steak.

728
00:38:53,481 --> 00:38:54,624
You're chipper.

729
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:57,041
That must mean
Damon is dead.

730
00:38:57,042 --> 00:38:58,151
Not quite.

731
00:38:58,152 --> 00:38:59,486
In fact, he
continues to be

732
00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:01,354
the bane
of my existence,

733
00:39:01,355 --> 00:39:03,657
but...

734
00:39:03,658 --> 00:39:05,218
Stefan and I
had a moment. Heh.

735
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:08,928
Don't worry.
I'll keep the details to myself,

736
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,831
but it definitely reaffirmed
his feelings for Elena,

737
00:39:11,832 --> 00:39:13,685
I.E. me. Heh.

738
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:16,803
So, uh, it's only
a matter of time.

739
00:39:16,804 --> 00:39:19,232
Sounds like you're going
to get everything you want.

740
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:21,608
Of course I will.

741
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,744
Assuming that you took
care of the Matt situation.

742
00:39:24,745 --> 00:39:27,947
Your secret is safe.

743
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:32,785
Perfect. So I'm in
a really good mood right now,

744
00:39:32,786 --> 00:39:34,854
which means I don't
really feel like worrying

745
00:39:34,855 --> 00:39:36,958
whatever's making
you mopey.

746
00:39:38,725 --> 00:39:41,728
You won't have to worry
about me for much longer.

747
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:45,665
What's that
supposed to mean?

748
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,552
Tyler Lockwood bit me.

749
00:39:57,744 --> 00:39:59,812
Hey. When'd
you get here?

750
00:39:59,813 --> 00:40:02,817
Eh, about 1 1/2
of these ago.

751
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:03,901
Hmm.

752
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,518
You were right.

753
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:07,153
I brought this
on myself.

754
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,755
I knew the Klaus thing was
gonna come with consequences.

755
00:40:09,756 --> 00:40:11,824
Guess now I just
have to deal with it

756
00:40:11,825 --> 00:40:13,459
and learn
from my mistakes.

757
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,127
Glad I could help.

758
00:40:15,128 --> 00:40:16,247
So did you find Matt?

759
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:18,331
Yes, and Tyler
was right.

760
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,366
Nadia's been compelling
him to forget things.

761
00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:21,767
What do you mean?
What kind of things?

762
00:40:21,768 --> 00:40:23,402
Who knows? He tried
to message me,

763
00:40:23,403 --> 00:40:24,964
but Nadia
stopped him.

764
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:29,041
"Help. K"
was all I got.

765
00:40:29,042 --> 00:40:30,910
Huh.

766
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:33,181
So you and Elena?

767
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:34,746
What's the verdict?

768
00:40:34,747 --> 00:40:38,686
Um, well, the verdict is

769
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:40,772
she's acting strange.

770
00:40:40,773 --> 00:40:42,273
She kissed me.

771
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:43,566
Excuse me?

772
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:46,425
Yeah. My car broke down,
so we got a hotel room

773
00:40:46,426 --> 00:40:47,760
so she could shower...

774
00:40:47,761 --> 00:40:48,894
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

775
00:40:48,895 --> 00:40:50,796
You guys got
a hotel room

776
00:40:50,797 --> 00:40:52,298
with a shower?

777
00:40:52,299 --> 00:40:53,399
Yeah, but it wasn't
like that.

778
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,600
I mean, I stopped
it obviously.

779
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:55,834
I couldn't do it
to Damon.

780
00:40:55,835 --> 00:40:57,236
Yeah, but she could?

781
00:40:57,237 --> 00:40:58,470
I just... I don't
get it.

782
00:40:58,471 --> 00:41:00,139
She knows that this
would destroy him.

783
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,876
What is she doing?

784
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:03,409
That's what I mean.
It's like she's

785
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:06,111
given up on Damon,
and he thinks that

786
00:41:06,112 --> 00:41:08,547
she was trying to get
me to kill him tonight.

787
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,716
No. I mean, she
may be mad at him,

788
00:41:11,176 --> 00:41:13,619
but she would
never want him dead.

789
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,972
Unless...

790
00:41:16,755 --> 00:41:20,728
Matt texted you,
"help. K,"

791
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:23,189
before Nadia
stopped him.

792
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,942
"K," as in Katherine,

793
00:41:25,943 --> 00:41:28,276
and when Katherine
was dying,

794
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,936
Nadia figured out a way
to put Katherine's spirit

795
00:41:30,937 --> 00:41:32,604
inside Nadia's body.

796
00:41:32,605 --> 00:41:34,072
Yeah, but that
didn't happen

797
00:41:34,073 --> 00:41:35,702
because Katherine
had a change of heart.

798
00:41:38,744 --> 00:41:44,282
No. No. You don't
think that...

799
00:41:44,283 --> 00:41:48,620
It's impossible that
she'd be...

800
00:41:48,621 --> 00:41:49,855
We would have
noticed.

801
00:41:49,856 --> 00:41:52,723
It's Elena.
We know her.

802
00:41:55,827 --> 00:41:57,361
Oh, my God.

803
00:42:00,148 --> 00:42:02,570
